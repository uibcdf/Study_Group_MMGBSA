# Study Group

The goal is reading, word by word, more than 75 papers in three
months of the topic: predicting the binding free energy of interacting biomolecules withe the MM/GBSA methods.

Some rules to be all on the same page:

- Papers will be named with a key string made up of the family name of the firs author, the
  publication year and the first work of the title. For instance, the paper entitled "Why me?"
written by John Doe and published in 2020 will be referred to hereinafter as 'Doe2020Why'.

- The papers' list found in the file 'HISTORY.md' is a tentative guide. Week by week the file has
  to be updated to keep track of the real reading record.

- This is a private repository. Don't by shy sharing ideas and doubts either in the issues board or
  in the discussions area. It is good to have a written history of the learning process.

- Put a copy of the pdf versions of the papers in the directory 'papers'.

- After reading a paper, use the file 'NOTES.md' to write a three lines abstract togeter with some useful thoughts for your future you. Write also some keywords to tag the paper.


## Tips for the young researcher.

Is this your first research work? If you are at the begining of your scientific career, let us share with you some tips before start your reading:

- The main purpose of this exercise is understanding, not just knowing.
- Keep in mind from day one the open questions you have already. Be smart to indentify where the
  answers could be from the first paper you read.
- Do not feel overwhelmed running crazy after every single doubt. Don't try to
  check every reference in your first paper.
- Write down in your list new questions and doubts. Long term, having many doubts it is more
  effective than having a lot of answers.
- Work the first week in building a good and consistent structure of
doubts.
- Work later in having a good and consistent conceptual story covering all your doubts. Fill the gaps reading, searching and thinking, as if it were a detective work. The mist will vanish with time.
- You will probably have hundreds of ideas: Why this questions was not approached? Why this is not
  done? Write down all these ideas, they are gold, they can be the seed of your future scientific contributions.
- Having a big collection of unread papers in your computer does not make you smart.
- Having a big collection of unread papers in your computer does not mean you understand the topic.
- Look for the meaning of the spanish word "adanismo". Do you really think is a good attitude to
  start a scientific career?
- Spend 20 minutes in internet looking for what the "Dunning-Kruger effect or sindrom" is. Did you
  understand the plot confidence vs. knowledge? Where are you now? Where will you be in two weeks,
and in two years of digging in a topic?
- Enjoy learning. Enjoy suffering too. Don't be hasty.
- If you think everything is simple, 99% of probability you didn't understand a word.
- If you are not enjoying when concepts begin to fall into place, maybe this job won't make you happy.

This is far from being a shelf help guide. You can read about the following three empiric principles. And you can think: Aha, now that I know
I can do better. Ok, let us tell you something, let us dare to give you a last piece of wisdom: no, you can't.

- Hofstadter's Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.
- Paretos Law: "80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes. And 80% of the causes have only the 20% of the consequences."
- Jacob August Riis: "When nothing seems to help, I go look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that blow that did it, but all that had gone before."
